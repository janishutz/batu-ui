# Smoke Data Recorder

This repository contains the code running at [website here] soon(TM)

## Repository structure
- [./ui](./ui) Contains the Vue.js based GUI
- [./api](./api) Contains all the backend code for storing and managing the data

## TODOs
Here's a list of things still to be completed

### API
The API is basically complete, but these things are still needed:
- Don't hard code the password
- Maybe multiple users?

### GUI
- Design
- Stats (graphs, lists or similar)
- Cigaret animation with data analysis (data analysis could also be moved or stored on API) and skull particles
- Submit function with data checking -- done
- Load old data -- done (demo data available for October 3rd 2024, you can create your own by simply saving for a date)

### Project
- Add CI?
